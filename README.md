## Dnd_fruts

# Test project with drag and drop in Next JS

In this small game you need to move fruits to the right area to maintain progress.

Drag and drop was released by lib @dnd-kit(https://docs.dndkit.com/).

To run, clone the repository, and use this guy, or use your package manager:

```bash
npm init -y

```

First, run (I advise) the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
```
